What are the different 'pages' to display in my app? 

Main page, lists all of the polls and a navbar at the top with login button

	ROUTE - '/' - index route - main call to GET api/polls
		each poll is a box with a random color in the background? I dunno
		if logged in, top navbar has logout and a My Polls button instead

	ROUTE - '/poll/new' - make a new poll (if authenticated), will use POST api/polls

	ROUTE - '/poll/idOfPoll - view a poll, will use GET api/polls/single/:id

	ROUTE - '/user/userId' - Users page where they can view/delete/modify their polls




What type of State do I need to keep track of? 

	User state
		default, not logged in, no user
		once logged in, store user _id, username, and token in state

	Poll state
		Active Poll state, just having whatever poll we need to show on screen with content
		List of Polls state, just a big list of all the possible polls

	bring in all the data right at the start and just model it up front in redux? 
		+ don't have to make a ton of different ajax calls
		- defeating purpose of the backend routes? 

Where do I do my ajax calls?
